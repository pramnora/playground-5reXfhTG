Today, I went along to go and visit...
http://tech.io
...where they have 'code playgrounds' that anyone is allowed to freely explore by clicking on the 'explore' button;
and, then, choosing whichever programming language they are interested in learning.

First, I choose Hexe...which is a programming language I've never ever used before; there was some example Hexe code given...
and, I hit the button: Run, to make it execute. Next, I decided to re-write that single line of output code by introducing
my own text, instead; and, once more, hit: Run...and, sure enough, the code I ran worked! I had successfully created 
my very first Hexe program.

Now, I wanted to discover a way to go and create my own 'code playground'...; so, I clicked the button: Create Playground;
I choose the Python language to give an example in...; and, then, wrote the following Python code.

# In programming...we, usually, comment our code in order to explain to other people reading our code what each line means.
# Code comments can also be used to add such things as: program name/programming language/time/date/author details/-etc.
#
# The hash: (#) sign symbol indicates a Python code comment...; 
# meaning whatever is written after the # sign symbol is NOT code to be executed; 
# but, instead, is just 'plain text' to be read;
# and, therefore, whatever text is written after the # will just be totally ignored by the Python code interpreter.
#
# Yet, another way to write a code comment is like so: #***; 
# and, this method of writing comments is used to make the comments stand out that much clearer...;
# this is called 'horizontal indentation'.
#
# A # comment need not have any text being written after it at all...;
# because it's purpose is to serve as 'vertical indentation', instead.
# Both 'horizontal' and 'vertical' indentation serves to make code layout on the page that much easier to read;
# because they introduce the concept of 'white space' around the text.
#
# Just as in reading normal english...we might 'horizontally indent' the paragraph's first sentence/
# and, then, vertically indent between each seperate paragraph;
# rather than jumbling up everything together as being a single ratherconfusing text block...?!  
#
#*** This is how you print text...; 
#    by enclosing the text inside of a pair of double quote marks;
#    the quote marks you choose may be either single('')/or else, paired("")...
print('Hello World!')
print("Goodbye World!")
#
#*** This is how you print numbers...;
print(1)
#    ...notice that unlike 'text'/numbers do NOT have any quote marks around them.
#    Also, if the numbers do include a sum expression: 
#    plus(+),minus(-),multiplication(*),division(/);
#    then, the sum result of that expression will be, immediately, evaluated, first; before doing any print out...;
#    in this particular case, the sum result of 1+1 is, first, evaluated; 
#    then, Python prints out the resulting sum total value which, of course, is the answer: 2
print(1+1) 
#*** Now, we are going to print out a combined mixture of both text/numbers together...
print("1 + 1 =",1+1)

First, I ran the above code to make sure it worked; then, I went and hit the button: My Playgrounds...; 
and, there I found the above program code had been, automatically, saved; it's status said, 'Pending'...
which, I guess, must mean they are going to check out my code before releasing it to the general public.
Anyway, on that note I will now take my leave... ;-)

NOTE: I choose to save my code into GitHub...as opposed to opting to save it into Tech.io;
which is why the code has been published here, instead.
